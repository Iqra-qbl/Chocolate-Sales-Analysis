# CHOCOLATE SALES ANALYSIS

**Chocolate Sales Analysis** is a comprehensive data analysis project designed to explore, analyze, and visualize chocolate sales data across multiple countries. Built using Python and various data analysis libraries, this project provides insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional demand through intuitive visualizations and statistical analysis. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle (link provided below) and is of a reasonable size, well under the 100GB repository limit.

## Dataset Content
The dataset used in this project is the **Chocolate Sales Dataset** from Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales)  

It contains detailed records of chocolate sales transactions, including:  
- **Amount**: Sales revenue in dollars  
- **Boxes Shipped**: Number of chocolate boxes shipped per transaction  
- **Country**: Six countries (Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, UK, USA)  
- **Product**: Specific chocolate products (e.g., Smooth Silky Salty, 50% Dark Bites)  
- **Date**: Transaction dates spanning 2022 
- **Salesperson**: Names of salespeople (removed during cleaning)  
The dataset is relatively clean with no missing, empty, or duplicate values, making it suitable for analysis after minor preprocessing.

## Business Requirements

1. **Understand Sales Distribution**: Identify total sales and percentage contributions by country and product category.  
2. **Identify Top Performers**: Determine the top-selling products and countries driving revenue.  
3. **Analyze Efficiency**: Calculate revenue per box shipped to assess profitability across products and categories.  
4. **Explore Trends**: Investigate sales trends over time, focusing on seasonality and holiday impacts.  
5. **Visualize Insights**: Provide clear, actionable visualizations for stakeholders to understand key findings.

**Business KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**

• Total Sales Revenue– Measure of overall performance.
Average Revenue per Box Shipped – Indicates profitability per shipment.
• Sales Growth Over Time – Month-over-month or year-over-year comparison.
• Sales Performance by Country – Identifies high-performing regions.
• Product Performance Analysis – Determines best-selling and most profitable products.

4. Data Requirements

Sales Data (Salesperson, Country, Product, Date, Amount, Boxes Shipped).
Timeframe Consideration – Seasonality trends based on monthly/quarterly data.
Customer Demographics (if available) – To analyze purchasing behavior.

5. Expected Deliverables

Sales Trends Analysis Report – Identifying peak sales periods and seasonality effects.
Product Performance Dashboard – Highlighting top-selling and high-revenue products.
Salesperson Performance Report – Comparing efficiency across different employees.
Revenue Optimization Strategy – Recommendations for improving profitability.





## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 

## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
